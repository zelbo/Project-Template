# Project-Template
Github boilerplate files, such as ReadMe and gitignore.

# What to include?
gitignore, license, readme.md, 

# License
While I like the idea of requiring the ability to incorporate improvements from your version of my code as part of the deal of being allowed to use my code,
which I believe to be the main benefit of GPL, the nature of MIT may increase the chances of a potential contributor even looking at a project in the first place.
Using any GPL code forces a project to become GPL compliant, which might cause a change to the default license of this project.

# Coding Conventions
Use language specific style guides, generally.
Tabs over spaces (the whole point of tab is to indent a section of text), unless that would interfere with a language's own requirements.
Need style guids for python, C#, godot, R, javascript.
As a beginner, many of my projects will include comment blocks at the bottom of files containing examples and explanations of functions and syntax.
I need to come up with a tool to automatically strip these sections from production code, for copyright issues if nothing else.

# Github flavored markdown
Need a readme template that includes common examples.
Heading, coloring?, tables, lists, code blocks, links.

# Design Doc
Most of my projects include a text file containing an ideas dump.
